## Description:
**TL;DR: Let the bot answer you with the voice of your favorite character!** 

An extension to [oobabooga's textgen-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) allowing you to hear **ANY** voice of your choice generated by [Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion Project](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebU)

## How it works

Input from TextGen > Silero TTS > Magic of RVC > To chat history

Technically it's hijacking the audio from Silero TTS and redirecting it to RVC
