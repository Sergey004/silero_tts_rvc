## Description:
**TL;DR: Let the bot answer you with the voice of your favorite character!** 

An extension to [oobabooga's textgen-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) allowing you to hear **ANY** voice of your choice generated by [Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion Project](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebU)

At this moment paths for .pth and .index is hard-coded, but you can edit this paths

## How install this
``git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Sergey004/silero_tts_rvc``

## How it works

Input from TextGen > Silero TTS > Magic of RVC > To chat history

Technically it's hijacking the audio from Silero TTS and redirecting it to RVC

## File to be downloaded and put in the root (or root of your hard drive, idk where this file loads) of the extension.

Credit to [serp-ai](https://github.com/serp-ai) for making rvc_infer.py, a file that made the impossible possible. 


If you ask me how it works, I can tell you one thing: **I DON'T KNOW.**
